previously written environment.yml was moved and the changes were added to the new yml file.

error: environment has no access-key or secret-key

juju bootsrap
error:no tools
sudo juju -v sync-tools

roshan@ubuntu-cloud:~$ sudo juju bootstrap
error: cannot start bootstrap instance: cannot run instances: gomaasapi: got error back from server: 409 CONFLICT

CONFLICT from maas means that it doesn't have any nodes available for juju to acquire (juju bootstrap needs to boot a node).
It's not the best error unfortunately, juju needs fixing to show all the text. You need the server edition of 12.04
