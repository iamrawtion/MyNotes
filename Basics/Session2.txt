Scalable LAMP based architechture:
traffice increases to the page during a particular season so scaling is needed
Amazon has Elastic load balancer
RDS managed MySQL server

If CPU load goes above 60% increase
CPU latency menmory is checked time and again
Sacle up when more requests are encountered
Lower threshold e.g for a period of 15 min i want to scale down
Server could be Apache/Nginx/Cherokee
Nginx is light weight and fast
Cherokee is also light weight and fast too
Memcache is Elastic Cache : EVery file stored has a TTL time to leave (may be) after that time teh files are deleted from the cache
