Why editors matter?
editors make things easy, for programming, take time to learn the editor and get fast and proficient in editing. advatntage of vi is if you are fast for 6 months, you will not have to think about editing it goes into ur senses because of the  shortcuts and you may not necessarily need a mouse. If you are using vi and using arrow or mouse then its no point in using Vi. Olden times typist used to learn t ype without moving hand
Keybord has two ridges F and H keys why? 
KeyBoard shortcuts .vimrc file
insert mode 
command mode
normal mode
insert mode to edit file
press escape and come in commad mode these are all commands
command mode if we press ':' we come in command mode
olden days then ':' used to be present and a person used to remember everything and type all stuff
then ex editor was modified to make a "visual" editor hence the name vi they kep : command mode cos ppl were used to it
to go from normal to insert mode press i
a is for append in normal mode A to append at the end of the line
to come to normal mode press esc again
vi knows concept of a line a para
you can type a command that deletes a line 
number command -> this repeats the command number of times mentioned
charactor word sentence paragraph
c w s p
3 c 
delete 3 charaters
dd - delete the line
to copy the terminology used is yank
y will copy
2y wil copy two words
yy copies the line
p paste after the cursor
P before the cursor
3p pastes 3 times
0 takes you to the beginning of the line
pg means start of file G enf=d of file
along with a number any command can also be given a range
gg=G go to start of file indent to end of file = if for indent == indents one line
5= will indent 5 lines
