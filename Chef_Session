What is a a cookbook
resources are what u define serive, template etc
use recipes to write ur resources
cookbook is package f chef recipe
could contain files, .recipes etc
e.g apache can be a cookbook some other server could be a cookbook
the problem : need a webserver to show gome page
solution
install apache start service
write ur home page

COokbook called APache
go to the home directory
recipes are where you define your resources
default.rb is the default resource

once you define what u want to install for e.g for ubuntu apt-get for centos for yum etc... you dont have to be bothered what and how it needs to be done it will install 
ruby -c file_name.rb
tells u if u have nay syntax error in the script
